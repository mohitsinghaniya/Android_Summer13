3. Science Reference
4. Periodic Table

To use the apps - 
1. Download the apk file for the corresponding app available under the "Download App" folder.
2. Copy the file to your phone (you can copy the file either in SD card or directly in phone memory).
3. Select the file copied to the phone for installing.
4. Follow instructions.
Enjoy the App.
